# VecPic: Turn Raster Graphics into SVG 

> Because I am a student, I could not afford the fee of Apple Developer, so the binary is not code-signed.

## Build upon open source. Free Forever
This project leverages the power of [VTracer](https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer), which is built with Rust. However, official VTracer uses command line as UI, which is not very comfortable for normal users.
Therefore, I made this project!

**VecPic**: iOS app as frontend for user.

**VecPicServer**: A backend server which is built with REST API design. Running on local machine.
